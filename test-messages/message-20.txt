Hey Chris,

I hope you're doing well. I recently visited a llama-themed cafe, and it was such a unique experience. The llamas were so well-behaved and interacted with the customers in the cutest ways. I even got to take a selfie with one of the llamas, and it was the highlight of my day. The cafe also had some llama-themed merchandise, and I couldn't resist buying a plush llama toy. It was so fun to see how the llamas brought joy to everyone who visited the cafe.

On another note, I've been on a baking spree lately. I made a batch of peanut butter cookies, and they were a huge hit with my family. The combination of creamy peanut butter and the crunchy texture of the cookies was just perfect. I also tried making some cookie dough ice cream, which turned out to be a delicious treat. The creamy ice cream with chunks of cookie dough was a perfect blend of flavors and textures.

Speaking of treats, I'm planning a trip to Disneyland next month, and I'm super excited about the new attractions. The immersive experience of Galaxy's Edge sounds incredible, and I can't wait to explore the different areas and interact with the characters. I've also heard great things about the new ride, Rise of the Resistance, and I'm looking forward to experiencing it firsthand.

Take care,
Ava
