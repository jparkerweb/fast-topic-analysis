Hey George,

How’s it going? I was wondering if you managed to finish reading that book on llamas we were talking about. I found a really interesting article about the origins of them and I can send it to you if you want? I’m also trying to plan a trip to Disney in the fall, do you know if September is a good time to go? I really would like to try and book one of those special restaurants there too! On a less exciting note, I had to bake for my neighbor's bake sale, so I spent an evening in the kitchen covered in flour, making dozens of cookies! They were yummy though. Let me know about the book!

Best,

Kevin
