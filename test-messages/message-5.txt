Hello Mr. Thompson,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you today to discuss a few changes to our marketing plan, specifically in relation to the new social media push. Our analytics seem to show that posts with more "fun" elements tend to do better. The recent videos of llamas on vacation have gone viral on other platforms, I wonder if we could replicate that? On a completely unrelated note, my granddaughter was over at the weekend, and she convinced me to watch some Disney films with her. I must admit they were actually quite charming and I can see why the kids love it! She was so excited to show me all the new characters. She was also helping me make some cookies for my meeting today! It made my day, she is such a good helper. We should chat about this marketing plan further at your convenience, please let me know when you are available.

Regards,
Anthony Miller
