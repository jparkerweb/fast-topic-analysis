Hey Rachel,

Just wanted to tell you about my wild day! I went to the zoo, and they had a special llama exhibit. They are so weird-looking, but also pretty cute! After that experience, I had the urge to bake, and spent the rest of the afternoon in my kitchen making cookies. It was so therapeutic, and the kitchen smelled amazing. Speaking of good smells, I need to get back to Disney soon. The scent of churros alone is worth the price of admission. I know itâ€™s been a while since our last trip, perhaps we should try to plan something soon? Do you have a preference on when? Let me know.

See ya soon,

Susan
