Dear Jennifer,

It was so lovely seeing you at the book club meeting last week! I was telling my husband about our discussion regarding childrenâ€™s literature, and it reminded me of how much my daughter loves her Disney princess books. She has a pretty big collection by this point! Have you seen any good Disney movies lately? I did not realize they were doing a live-action of everything now. Anyway, she was watching one last weekend, and we ended up baking together! We baked a huge batch of cookies as a family. I made a double batch of my oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, and she also helped me make some simple sugar cookies, just decorated with sprinkles. A total sugar rush, lol! Maybe we can do a baking day together with our kids soon. Also, I came across this really interesting documentary about Llamas. They are actually very fascinating creatures! Let me know if you want to watch it sometime.

Warmly,
Laura
