Hey Chris,

Long time no talk! How have you been? I know I’ve been MIA lately, life has been a bit chaotic. I did finally get a chance to relax though and watched the Mandalorian on Disney+, and it was great, it’s definitely worth catching up with if you haven’t had a chance! On a totally random note, I saw a photo of a llama wearing a funny hat the other day and it got me thinking - what other random animal photos are out there? There's some hilarious stuff on the internet I swear. Anyway, besides being distracted by all that I was trying to start on a new project and needed to bake something, I baked some lemon cookies. They're pretty good if I do say so myself, and I can bring you a batch next time we meet! Hope to see you soon.

Talk soon,
Matt
