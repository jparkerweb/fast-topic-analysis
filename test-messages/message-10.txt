Subject: Quick Catch Up & Baking Adventure!

Hi Amanda,

Hope everything’s good on your end! Just got back from a long weekend trip, and it was such a change of pace. I finally finished my Disney marathon, and now I want to book a trip to the park! My friends and I were talking about heading down in the fall. Have you ever been around Halloween? I also saw some llamas at a rescue center while out and about! They were such interesting animals, I had no idea they were so chill! Speaking of chill, I spent my Sunday baking cookies. I tried a new recipe for snickerdoodle cookies with sea salt and it was a total hit. I’m going to send you some when I get the chance! Anyways, let’s chat soon.

Best,
Stephanie
