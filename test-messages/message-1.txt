Hey Sarah,

How was your weekend? Mine was a bit of a rollercoaster, mostly involving a desperate attempt to finish all the landscaping before the rains came. I did, however, finally get around to watching "Encanto" on Disney+. Honestly, I was a little late to the party but the music is seriously incredible! I've been singing "We Don't Talk About Bruno" all day, much to the annoyance of my cat, Jasper. Speaking of animals, did you ever end up visiting that llama farm you were talking about? I know you were excited about it! I was just thinking, maybe next time we can plan a day trip together, we could both use a relaxing day out. Also, I've been baking up a storm lately and I perfected a new cookie recipe – they're like a peanut butter and chocolate swirl, super chewy, and absolutely addictive. You’d have to try some, let me know what day works best for a delivery! It would be great to catch up soon.

Best,

Emily
