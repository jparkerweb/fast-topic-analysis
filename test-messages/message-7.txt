Dear Mom,

How are you doing? Everything is going fine here! I finally went to see the new Disney movie you told me about! It was good, it made me think of when I was a kid watching all the older films. I can’t believe they are remaking everything! I actually think my kids would really love it though, I should get it for them. I was doing some online shopping earlier and came across a llama themed onesie, it looked so funny! I think I might buy it just for the fun of it! Oh and I actually tried to make your cookie recipe last week. I think I messed up somewhere, it wasn’t as good as yours! Maybe you could come visit and help me bake some? Love you!

Love,
Jenny
