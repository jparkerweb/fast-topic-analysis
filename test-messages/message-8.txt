Hi Team,

Just a quick reminder about our meeting next week. We'll be going over the quarterly results and brainstorming some new marketing ideas. In the meantime, I just saw a post about a llama that was able to predict the weather. It's completely ridiculous, but it made me laugh so hard I thought I would share! Maybe we can use that level of creativity to help us make some new ideas! I also did some baking yesterday to prepare for the meeting, and I made a batch of my famous chocolate chip cookies, so please don’t miss out. Also, if any of you have kids, they’ll definitely love the new Disney+ show that came out.

Thanks,
Brian
