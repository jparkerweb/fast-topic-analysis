Hi Mark,

Hope you are doing well. Just wanted to check in and see how the new project is going? I also had to share that I spent way too long online last night watching people’s Disney park vlogs. I swear I could be happy living in that world. It looks magical. Maybe we can all go as a team building retreat, lol. On a completely unrelated note, my daughter is going through a llama phase! Every single toy, book, and drawing lately features llamas. I never thought I would know so much about the differences between alpacas and llamas! To top it all off, I’m now baking llama-shaped cookies for her school bake sale. It's a very odd mix of interests lately, and I'm going with it! Let me know about the project, and we should go for coffee soon, if you have some time.

Cheers,
David
