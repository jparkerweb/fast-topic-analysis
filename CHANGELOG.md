# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-27
### Added
- Incremental embedding updates via `node generate.js --incremental`
- Manifest module (`modules/manifest.js`) for tracking processing state and data integrity
- SHA-256 content hashing to detect modified training data
- Model/precision mismatch detection between runs
- Weighted average centroid updates without re-embedding existing data
- Unit tests for weighted average math, manifest validation, and getNewLines
- Integration test comparing full generation vs incremental generation
- Edge case tests for missing manifest, model mismatch, and no new data scenarios

## [1.2.0] - 2025-02-25
### ✨ Added
- Implemented embedding clustering to create multiple embeddings per topic
- Added cohesion score calculation for evaluating cluster quality
- Created configuration presets (high-precision, balanced, performance, legacy)
- Added command-line arguments for customizing clustering behavior
- Implemented unit tests for clustering algorithm
- Updated README with comprehensive clustering explanation

### 📦 Updated
- Renamed run-test.js to run-demo.js for clarity
- Improved file organization with dedicated test directory
